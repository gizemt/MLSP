This repository contains code for a source separation project.

The goal is to use matrix-based source separation on a single-channel audio recording to determine the speakers at a given time and estimate each speaker's total speaking time from the audio recordings.

An automated system like this could be used in meetings, debates, etc. to make sure everyone gets fair speaking time.

This project is inspired by a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/12/us/elections/debate-speaking-time.html) and [infographic](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/us/debate-speaking-time-promo-1568330318099/debate-speaking-time-promo-1568330318099-superJumbo-v7.jpg).
